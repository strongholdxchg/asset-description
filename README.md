#Asset Description

This is an open source asset description framework for the Stellar ecosystem.  The intention for this is to be a framework for issuers on the Stellar network to give information about the asset they are issueing.  This could be added to the .toml file for each asset.

This was inspired by Dr. David Mazieres.
